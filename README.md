Single Feature Linear Regression

It is a method to predict the dependent variable (Y) based on the values of independent variable (X). It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find out a linear function that predicts the response value (y) as accurately as possible as a function of the feature (or independent variable) (x).
